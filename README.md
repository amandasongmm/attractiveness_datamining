# attractiveness_datamining
This datamining project is based on a twin attractiveness rating dataset. 
(Germine et al. Individual Aesthetic Preferences for Faces Are Shaped Mostly by Environments, Not Genes. Current Biology, October 2015)

We aim at discovering different types of attractiveness preferences among the population 
and quantitatively examining the impact of nature vs nuture in shaping personal preference for facial attractiveness.
